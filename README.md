# expect-assert
Extension for mocha that expects any assertion to have run in each test otherwise throwing error.

# Tested with:
* Chai:
  * Expect
  * Assert
  * Should *(extended only)

## Installation
1.  Require at start of tests or in your testing config.
    ```
    const expectAssert = require('./index');
    ```
2. Instantiate with your assertion of choice.
    ```
    const expect = expectAssert(chai.expect);
    ```
3. Use where you need.

### Alternative global setup with mocha root hook plugin

```
// hooks.js
const expectAssert = require('expect-assert');
chai.expect = expectAssert(chai.expect); // override expect() everywhere
```

Register the hooks in mocha:

```
mocha --require expect-assert/hooks hooks.js
```
